2. **Code Chunking** - Complete code blocks now retrieved intact
3. **Ranking Algorithm** - Proper prioritization of relevant content
4. **Semantic Understanding** - Successfully handles abstract concepts

### Remaining Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Hybrid Search Implementation

**Current Status**: Semantic search working well but could be enhanced

**Enhancement**:
```python
def hybrid_search(query, k=10):
    # Current semantic search (already good)
    semantic_results = vector_search(query, k=k)
    
    # Add BM25 for exact keyword matching
    keyword_results = bm25_search(query, k=k)
    
    # Combine with weighted scores
    combined = merge_results(
        semantic_results, weight=0.7,  # Higher weight since it's working well
        keyword_results, weight=0.3
    )
    
    return combined[:k]
```

### 2. Cross-Encoder Reranking

**Current Status**: Good initial ranking but could be refined

**Enhancement**:
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

class Reranker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2')
    
    def rerank(self, query, candidates, top_k=5):
        # Score all candidates
        pairs = [[query, candidate.content] for candidate in candidates]
        scores = self.model.predict(pairs)
        
        # Sort and return top k
        ranked = sorted(zip(candidates, scores), 
                       key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return ranked[:top_k]
```

### 3. Enhanced Test Data Coverage

**Current Gap**: Limited coverage of certain UVM patterns

**Additions Needed**:
```systemverilog
// Add uvm_config_db examples
class my_env extends uvm_env;
    function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        super.build_phase(phase);
        if (!uvm_config_db#(virtual my_if)::get(this, "", "vif", vif))
            `uvm_fatal("NOVIF", "Virtual interface not found")
    endfunction
endclass

// Add factory pattern examples
class my_test extends uvm_test;
    function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        my_driver::type_id::set_type_override(custom_driver::get_type());
    endfunction
endclass
```

### 4. Context Window Expansion

**Current Status**: Good chunk retrieval but could benefit from context

**Enhancement**:
```python
def retrieve_with_context(chunk_id, context_window=1):
    # Get target chunk
    target = get_chunk(chunk_id)
    
    # Get surrounding chunks from same document
    before = get_chunks_before(chunk_id, n=context_window)
    after = get_chunks_after(chunk_id, n=context_window)
    
    return {
        "target": target,
        "context": {
            "before": before,
            "after": after
        },
        "full_text": combine_chunks(before + [target] + after)
    }
```

### 5. Performance Metrics Dashboard

**Need**: Track system performance over time

**Implementation**:
```python
class RAGMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'mrr': [],  # Mean Reciprocal Rank
            'ndcg': [],  # Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
            'precision_at_k': [],
            'avg_score': [],
            'response_time': []
        }
    
    def evaluate_query(self, query, results, ground_truth):
        mrr = self.calculate_mrr(results, ground_truth)
        ndcg = self.calculate_ndcg(results, ground_truth)
        precision = self.calculate_precision(results, ground_truth, k=5)
        
        self.metrics['mrr'].append(mrr)
        self.metrics['ndcg'].append(ndcg)
        self.metrics['precision_at_k'].append(precision)
        
        return self.generate_report()
```

### 6. Advanced Metadata Enrichment

**Current Status**: Basic metadata working well, could be enhanced

**Enhancement**:
```yaml
metadata:
  # Current (working)
  file_type: "systemverilog"
  chapter: "Chapter 4"
  section: "4.3"
  
  # Proposed additions
  construct_type: "class"  # or "module", "interface", "package"
  class_hierarchy:
    - parent: "uvm_monitor"
    - implements: ["analysis_port"]
  patterns:
    - "monitor_pattern"
    - "tlm_communication"
  complexity: "intermediate"
  dependencies:
    - "uvm_pkg"
    - "apb_interface"
```

### 7. Testing Framework

**Create Benchmark Dataset**:
```json
{
  "test_queries": [
    {
      "query": "uvm_object base class methods",
      "expected_chunks": ["44daa3fd-dd31-4389-a4f2-fc412bd892b4"],
      "relevance_threshold": 0.7,
      "must_include_terms": ["create", "copy", "pack", "unpack"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k)
- Precision@k
- Recall@k

### 8. Reranking Pipeline

**Implementation**:
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

class Reranker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2')
    
    def rerank(self, query, candidates, top_k=5):
        # Score all candidates
        pairs = [[query, candidate.content] for candidate in candidates]
        scores = self.model.predict(pairs)
        
        # Sort and return top k
        ranked = sorted(zip(candidates, scores), 
                       key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return ranked[:top_k]
```
