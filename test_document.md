# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections.

### Key Concepts

- **Perceptron**: The simplest form of neural network
- **Backpropagation**: Learning algorithm for training networks
- **Activation Functions**: Functions that determine neuron output

## Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns in data.

### Popular Architectures

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Excellent for image processing
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Good for sequential data
3. **Transformers**: State-of-the-art for natural language processing

## Practical Applications

Machine learning algorithms are used in:

- Computer vision and image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

## Getting Started with Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that offers memory safety and performance. Here's a simple example:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, machine learning!");

    let data = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
    let mean = data.iter().sum::<f64>() / data.len() as f64;

    println!("Mean: {}", mean);
}
```

This demonstrates basic data processing concepts that are fundamental to machine learning implementations.
